# ğŸ“š Data Structures Implementations

This repository contains C++ implementations of fundamental data structures as part of my intensive training plan.  
Each data structure is implemented in a separate `.cpp` file with a simple main function to demonstrate its usage.

## âœ… Implemented Data Structures

- ğŸŸ¢ **Dynamic Array**
  - File: `dynamic_array.cpp`
  - Resizable array implementation that doubles its capacity when full.

- ğŸŸ¢ **Singly Linked List**
  - File: `singly_linked_list.cpp`
  - Linked list with basic insert, remove, and print operations.

- ğŸŸ¢ **Stack (Array-based)**
  - File: `stack_array.cpp`
  - Stack implemented using a fixed-size array.

- ğŸŸ¢ **Stack (Linked List-based)**
  - File: `stack_linked_list.cpp`
  - Stack implemented using a singly linked list.

## ğŸš€ How to Compile & Run

Open a terminal in the repository folder and run:

```bash
g++ <filename>.cpp -o <filename>
./<filename>
